Dataset description: 
The dataset contains medical information about patients, like gender, age, various diseases, and smoking status.
Each row in the data provides relevant attributes about the patient.

Dataset source: https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset

Our questions:
1) predict whether a patient is likely to get a stroke based on the input parameters.                                                                     2) predict blood glucose level a patient is likely to have based on the input parameters.
3) predict whether a patient is likely to have a hypertension based on the input parameters
4) predict whether a patient is likely to have a heart disease based on the input parameters

# Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing is one of the most important things, and it is one of the common factors of success of a model.
We took care of a few things:

* Splitting of the data set in Training and Validation sets
* Taking care of Missing values
* Taking care of Categorical Features
* Treating outliers
* Normalization of data set

techniques we use:
